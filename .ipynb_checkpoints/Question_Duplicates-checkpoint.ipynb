Because of the implementation of the loss function we will see in the next section, we are not going to have the cosine similarity as output of our Siamese network, but rather $v_1$ and $v_2$. we will add the cosine distance step once we reach the classification step. \n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, we will use the triplet loss (explained below). This loss makes use of a baseline (anchor) input that is compared to a positive (truthy) input and a negative (falsy) input. The (cosine) distance from the baseline input to the positive input is minimized, and the distance from the baseline input to the negative  input is maximized. Mathematically, we are trying to maximize the following.\n",
